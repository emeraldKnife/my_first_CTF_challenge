# my_first_CTF_challenge
This is my first CTF challenge that uses LSB steganography and web exploitation.

The city of OZ has an ancient code that is unknown to the new generation. Somehow, after many excavations, people found a picture of the city and a text note that said, "Within lies the divine code..."!

People of OZ are curious to know the code. Help them find the hidden code within the picture.
